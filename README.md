# SIGNSense: Bridging Worlds

## Purpose:

SIGNSense is a groundbreaking application designed to bridge the communication gap between deaf and non-deaf individuals. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, it provides an intuitive interface where users can seamlessly understand sign language through a graphical context. Whether you're deaf or non-deaf, SIGNSense offers a platform for inclusive communication and understanding.

## Usage & Current Functionality:

Using SIGNSense is effortless. Simply point your device's camera towards the sign language speaker, and watch as the application instantly converts the signs into text in real-time. This mobile application empowers users to translate sign language anytime, anywhere, fostering greater accessibility and inclusivity.

### Home Page

Upon launching SIGNSense, users are greeted with a user-friendly home page offering three options: Login, Register, or Continue as Guest. Authentication allows users to save and access their translation history seamlessly.

### Login and Register

Registering an account is straightforwardâ€”users can sign up using their email and password, creating a unique profile. Upon logging in, the app generates a unique user ID for personalized access to backend features and translation history.

### Camera Page

The heart of SIGNSense lies in its camera page, where users can record and convert sign language into readable text in real-time. The interface provides visual feedback, adjusting color and providing helpful prompts like "Keep Steady for accurate results" based on the confidence score of translations.

### Settings Page

Customization is key in SIGNSense. Users can tailor their experience by adjusting theme, color, and font-size preferences. Additionally, they can manage login/logout actions conveniently from the settings menu.
